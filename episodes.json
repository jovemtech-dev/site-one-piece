He is stopped by Mr. 2, who reminds him what happened last time he tried to battle the Chief Warden. Magellan blasts a Hydra at the escapees. Just before Luffy is poisoned a second time, Mr. 3 shows up and uses a Candle Wall to block the poison. Crocodile comments Mr. 3 is not so useless after all. Jinbe overhears the conversation between Magellan and some guards. Mr. 2 and Mr. 1 team up and take down the guards with ease. Meanwhile, Luffy and Mr. 3 team up with some escapees who shoot Magellan. Although the bullets just barrage through him (though not being a Logia, but a Paramecia), Magellan gets hurt. Mr. 3 armors Luffy's fists and feet so the latter can finally attack Magellan. The two get in a fight between venom and wax"

With Luffy's wax armor rendered useless, the remaining escapees flee to the entrance with Magellan directly behind them. It is then that Ivankov, who managed to partially heal himself with the Horu Horu no Mi, comes bursting through the ground with Inazuma using Hell Wink. By clinging onto Ivankov's enlarged head while he uses another Hell Wink, Luffy and the others are finally able to breakout of Impel Down and be carried to the captured Marine ship by a school of Whale Sharks summoned by Jinbe, all seconds before being caught by Magellan who stares on in disbelief."

The Minister of the Right arrives at the plaza with some of the army and is informed of the situation. They join the battle against the New Fish-Man Pirates officially, allying themselves with the Straw Hats and Jinbe claiming they've made a terrible mistake for blaming them. Hammond is using human pirates as slaves in his Slave Tank and Jinbe asks Robin to free them, and she agrees. She frees them and easily defeats Hammond with her Double Clutch, breaking his back. The freed slaves then revolt against the New Fish-Man Pirates and ally themselves with the Straw Hat Crew. The Minister of the Left gets in touch with the Air Tank and is informed of the situation. He orders an evacuation of the island and all citizens attempt to leave the island. The whole island can hear Luffy's talk with the soldiers, Shirahoshi and Fukaboshi stating he knows who Hody Jones really is. He states Hody is a monster born from their environment. He states the officers are all the same and how they are just monsters born of hatred born from their ancestors and they fear their hatred will fade one day and so will their hatred towards humans and want them to be evil to justify their actions not even wanting peace for Fish-Men. He recalls what he asked what Humans did to Hody and Hody answers \"nothing\" and that they've been chosen by the heavens to punish humans and granted power. He goes on to state that their hatred is not from beliefs or experience, but they are nothing but empty opponents. At the same time, Hody laughs maniacally and with blood-shot eyes he charges at Luffy and Shirahoshi."

The marines cheered as their beloved vice admiral Vergo shows up but that turned to horror when he brutally assaulted them. Tashigi tries to defend them from him, but was viciously struck down. That action was enough to cause Sanji to come to the rescue, claiming he heard her tears falling. The Straw Hats (minus Sanji) and Brownbeard were still heading towards the end of the passage until the small dragon shows up and begins to attack them while Brownbeard suggests that he keeps running. Chopper manages to run into Mocha who was still hallucinating and manages to defeat the soldiers trying to apprehend her and give her a sedative to calm her down. Chopper then pleaded for her help to prevent the other children from eating the drugged candy. Meanwhile, Luffy and Smoker were racing towards Building C where they believed Caesar and Vergo were located. They entered the private room where Caesar was angrily ordering Monet to release the poison gas on the marines only to turn around in shock of seeing Luffy fist buried in his stomach, who declared that he won't let Caesar escape again."

At Cacao Island, Sanji completes his special ingredient, Pudding finishes with the chocolate, and Chiffon finishes baking the cake. The chefs then plan to complete the cake while on the way to the Thousand Sunny."
